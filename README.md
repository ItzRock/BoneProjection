# BoneProjection

What does this do? By itself it is not a mod. You still need to create an assetbundle of the character you want to load but instead of overriding the player model completely it takes a model and project its bones onto zoe for a complete animation set.
You will have to either add the tied bones script onto your model and fill it out in the editor or in code but, most of Zoe's bones are already filled out.
I recommend you also change the bones to your needs but what I have is a very generic armature

This has no support for changing artwork, any non player controller zoe's or voice lines.

Feel free to use code just please credit me.
If you are in need of support I am active in the Haste Discord https://discord.gg/ubfRaYG9kC

If you would like to contribute feel free. As well as making this README prettier
